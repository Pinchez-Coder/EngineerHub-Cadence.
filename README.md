### ✍️ Typography

- **Headings:** *Poppins* — modern, geometric sans-serif that conveys innovation and confidence.  
- **Body:** *Inter* — highly readable font optimized for web interfaces and technical content.  

Together, these fonts maintain a professional yet accessible tone aligned with engineering and tech branding.

## 🧩 Design Decisions

### 📐 Layout Adherence
- Designed and measured using **Figma** with an **8px spacing system** for visual consistency.  
- Tailwind CSS’s spacing scale was matched to Figma’s measurements.  
- Responsive layout tested at common breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl).  

### 💡 Creative Departures
- **Content Strategy:** Focused on clarity, brevity, and technical credibility — ensuring information is direct and accessible.  
- **Brand Positioning:** EngineerHub-Cadence differentiates itself through technical precision, reliable resources, and a modern engineering aesthetic.  
- **MD Breakpoint Design:** Unique middle-device layout prioritizes collapsible navigation and content stacking for improved usability.

## 🏗️ Component Architecture
The project follows a **modular, reusable component structure** for scalability and maintainability.

- **Structure:** Atomic design principles (Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Templates → Pages)  
- **State Management:** Minimal local state via React Hooks; future scalability allows integration with global state management libraries.  
- **Reusability:** Components are prop-driven and context-aware to minimize duplication and maximize flexibility.  

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations
- Implemented **lazy loading** for images and non-critical components.  
- **Code-splitting** and **dynamic imports** for faster initial load.  
- Optimized **Tailwind CSS purge** configuration to remove unused styles.  
- Compressed image assets via [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com).  
- Achieved **90+ Lighthouse scores** across Performance and Accessibility metrics.
